    The rotational effect of a sphere moving through air,
    known as the Magnus force, is of vital importance in 
    countless sports.  A slicing golf ball will veer into 
    the bush, and a curveball thrown just right can look 
    like a strike until the last second.  This program models
    the flights of various sports balls, taking both air 
    resistance and the Magnus effect into account.
